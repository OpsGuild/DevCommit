# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Added error handling for empty responses from AI providers (OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, Custom API) to prevent unexpected behavior when no choices are returned.
- Improved handling of empty content in OpenRouter responses to return an empty string instead of attempting to strip content.
