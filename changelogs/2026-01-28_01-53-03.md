# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated the `OpenRouterProvider` to use the `openai` library for API requests, providing more control over the request headers and payload.
- Changed the `OpenRouterProvider` to create a client with headers at the transport level instead of using default headers.
- Updated the `OpenRouterProvider` to use the standard `Referer` header instead of `HTTP-Referer` for API requests.
- Corrected the GitHub repository URL in the `Referer` header for `OpenRouterProvider` from `https://github.com/hordunlarmy/DevCommit` to `https://github.com/opsguild/DevCommit` for consistency.
- Removed the `extra_headers` parameter from the `generate_commit_message` method, as the headers are now set at the client level.
- Removed the `app_name` and `referer_url` parameters from the `OpenRouterProvider` constructor.
- Updated the `OpenRouterProvider` to no longer check for the presence of the `openai` library in its constructor.

### Fixed
- The `OpenRouterProvider` now correctly handles the response from the OpenRouter API, parsing the JSON response and extracting the generated commit message.

### Removed
- The `OpenRouterProvider` no longer sends raw HTTP requests to ensure the app name appears correctly in the OpenRouter dashboard, as this is now handled by the `openai` library.
- The `requests` library is no longer used by the `OpenRouterProvider` for making API requests.
